# Ground War
A C++ implementation of Ground War, a strategy board game I made in the spring of 2015.  

Any code in [this commit](https://github.com/LucasPickering/Ground-War-Cpp/commit/e95774b94736ac157e028d1bc44d342436bb9967)
was done as a project for CS 3500 (Programming in C++) in the fall of 2015 by myself, 
[Nicolas Berio LeBeau](https://github.com/nicobl), and [Christopher Che](https://github.com/chechris). 
That original repository can be found [here](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/pickl/GroundWar).
